<p>The Rainbow Fish lives in the deep blue waters where he is one of a kind - he has colorful and shiny scales.</p>
<p>While all of the other fish in the ocean wanted to play with him, he would always ignore them.</p>
<p>He was especially admired by little blue fish who followed him constantly and asked for one of his shiny scales, until the Rainbow Fish yelled at him to go away.</p>
<p>After this, no one wanted anything to do with the Rainbow Fish.
<p>This made the Rainbow Fish sad. He didn't understand why he was so lonely if he had the most beautiful scales in the ocean.</p>
<p>He talked to the starfish about it, but the starfish couldn't help. However, he did tell him to see the Wise Octopus.</p>
<p>The Wise Octopus told him that if he gave a glitter scale to each of the fish, he would become happier and less lonely.</p>
<p>He was hesitant, but as soon as he gave one to little blue fish, seeing how happy he was made him happy!</p>
<p>He began to give away more - the more he did the happer he was.</p>
<p>Although he was left with one shiny scale, he was so happy to see others happy. He was no longer lonely and had many friends!</p>
