    <div class="div23"><p>Phoebe Buffay is the quirky and fun best friend everyone wants in their life. Whether she is at Central Perk singing her <i>questionable</i> songs, or acting as her alias "Regina Phalange", she never fails to make me laugh. She is definitely my favorite character.<br><u>Favorite Lines:</u> "Ohhhhh No.", "They don't know that we know they know we know."<br><u>Notable Episode:</u> The One Where Everyone Finds Out</p></div>
    

    <div class="div33"><p>Chandler Bing is the caring but sarcastic one. No matter what is said, he will ALWAYS have the perfect sarcastic response. Although no one will ever know what he truly did for work, he will always be the most likeable character. For me, he is definitely up there in "Phoebe territory."<br><u>Favorite Lines:</u> "I'm not great at the advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?", "Hi, I'm Chandler. I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable."<br><u>Notable Episode:</u> The One With the Blackout </p></div>


    <div class="div43"> </div>


    <div class="div53"> </div>


    <div class="div63"><p>Rachel Green is the very ambitious and spirited fashionista, but can be self-involved at times. Despite this, she works tirelessly to get what she wants, is very kind-hearted, and has a great sense of humor. I would say that she is one of the characters that had the most growth throughout the series.<br><u>Favorite Lines:</u> "We are dessert stealers. We are living outside of the law.", "No uterus, no opinion."<br><u>Notable Episode:</u> The One With Joey's Big Break</p></div>


    <div class="div73">Ross Geller is a nerdy, but lovable Paleontologist. His goofy demeanor and passionate outburts never fail to get heads turning and eyebrows raising. Whether he is saying the wrong name at the altar or having a breakdown over someone eating his sandwhich, he is certainly a character.<br><u>Favorite Lines:</u> "PIVOT! PIVOT! PIVOT!", "We were on a BREAK!"<br><u>Notable Episode:</u> The One With Unagi</div>


    <div class="div83"> </div>


    <div class="div93"> </div>


    <div class="div103"><p>Monica Geller is the energetic and competitve friend in the group. She is a perfectionist who is the ULTIMATE neat-freak. If you know what's good for you, you won't think twice before putting a coaster under your drink! She always seems to have a solution to any problem that arises.<br><u>Favorite Lines:</u> "I KNOW!", "There are various levels of cleanliness, and when we say 'Monica clean,' we mean absolutely clean & spotless."<br><u>Notable Episode:</u> The One With All the Thanksgivings</p> </div>


    <div class="div113"><p>Joey Tribbiani is the charasmatic, yet very simple-minded friend of the group. Although it may take him a while to think of the right word, or get the point of a joke, he always has his friend's best interest at heart. However, you might want to think twice before you steal a french fry off of his plate...<br><u>Favorite Lines:</u> "How You Doin?", "You hide my clothes. I'm wearing EVERYTHING you own."<br><u>Notable Episode:</u> The One Where No One's Ready</p> </div>
