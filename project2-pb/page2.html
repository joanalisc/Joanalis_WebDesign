<h2>...New York City!</h2>

<h3>The Fountain</h3>
<p>The Fountain is one of the most notable locations part of the <i>Friends</i> franchise. It is mainly seen in the opening sequence of the show where Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, and Monica are running and dancing around the orange couch with umbrellas. Although the real fountain is not in NYC, the inspiration for the fountain is! The Cherry Hill Fountain can be found in Central Park. </p>

<h5>Monica's Apartment</h5>
<h6>What might be the coolest apartment ever, Monica's apartment is where the friends mostly reside. From the bright purple door and interior, to the teal kitchen, and everything in between, this apartment is everyone's dream NYC apartment! At one point, all of the 6 friends lived here. Monica never loses an opportunity to decorate! Not to mention the beautiful sight of the city skyline at night and... the less appealing sight of "ugly naked guy" across the street. Fans can visit what is seen as the exterior of the apartment at 90 Bedford St, New York, NY!</h6>

<h7>Central Perk</h7><br>
<h8>Central Perk is the most popular hangout in <i>Friends.</i> In almost every episode we see the 6 friends gathering on the famous orange couch drinking coffee and catching up. It gives off the ultimate "cozy vibes." Also, who doesn't want to hear Phoebe's hit song "Smelly Cat?" In my opinion, the best moments of the show often occurred here! This coffeeshop truly served as the heart of their friendship and the show in general.</h8>
